# Titanic Survival Analysis
---
## Overview

This project explores factors influencing survival on the Titanic and visualizes key patterns in the dataset. It also implements machine learning to predict survival probabilities.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and mapped categories for clarity.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualized survival rates by gender, class, and age distribution.
3. **Insights**:
   - Higher survival rates for females.
   - First-class passengers had better odds.
   - Young adults (15-35) formed the majority of travelers.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
